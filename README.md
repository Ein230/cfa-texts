# CFA Database

This repository represents the latest database edition for CFA. It can be used in conjunction with auto updates or on its own.

## How to use

To use the database without auto updates you have to:

1. Download the whole repository and then extract it on top of your CFA.
2. Copy Version.ini from the root into Text folder.

This will provide you with a working copy of CFA even if your auto updates are not working for some reason.

## Development

The `Text` folder contains individual fraction text files written in GML. New entries are added consecutively into their respective files, depending on clan/nation. Exact syntax is is not being covered in this Readme file.

`CardSprite` and `CardSpriteMini2` contains images that correspond to the database entries, every image is stored in `.jpg` format and their names start with an `n` and then contains a card number.

`Version.ini` represents current Text and Client versions and is used for update purposes.

`.md5sums` files are being auto generated by md5deep software, individual lines are ordered alphabetically by file name. They are used to perform a client-side integrity check of the images folder and then sync missing or outdated images. To re-generate the files, from the root execute two commands:

`.\md5deep64.exe -l .\CardSprite\* | sort /+37 > CardSprite.md5sums`

`.\md5deep64.exe -l .\CardSpriteMini2\* | sort /+37 > CardSpriteMini2.md5sums`
